	<h1>Hello and welcome to my card matching game!</h1>
	<div>The goal of the game is to match all cards with their pairs as quickly as possible</div>
	<ol>
		<li>Before the game begins you will be shown 8 cards face up for 3 seconds</li>
		<li>Once the cards are flipped down the timer begins</li>
		<li>You will be able to click to flip a pair of cards up</li>
		<li>If the cards are a match they will stay face up</li>
		<li>If the cards aren't a match they will flip back down and you will earn a strike</li>
		<li>The game ends when you either get 3 strikes or find every pair</li>
		<li>
			If you win you can add your name to our database and compare your time to other players!
