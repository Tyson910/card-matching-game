# Users
## Hello and welcome to my card matching game!

The goal of the game is to match all cards with their pairs as quickly as possible
                
1. Before the game begins you will be shown 8 cards face up for 3 seconds
2. Once the cards are flipped down the timer begins
3. You will be able to click to flip a pair of cards up
4. If the cards are a match they will stay face up
5. If the cards aren't a match they will flip back down and you will earn a strike
6. The game ends when you either get 3 strikes or find every pair
7. If you win you can add your name to our database and compare your time to other players!

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
